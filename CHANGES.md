# Changes

## 9.1.1

- [`3666289`](https://github.com/sinonjs/referee/commit/36662898c2f149e4485e45455188dade36262bde)
  Fix pending promise in async assertion on error (Maximilian Antoni)
    >
    > Fail the test with the thrown error message by rejecting the internal
    > assertion promise. Without handling the exception, the assertion promise
    > wouldn't be resolved or rejected and a test case awaiting the promise
    > would hang.
    >

## 9.1.0

- [`910e80c`](https://github.com/sinonjs/referee/commit/910e80c85b88cf8fc0e5a6fd53262c11d7b125bc)
  Allow functions for assert and refute messages (Morgan Roderick)
    >
    > This allows for dynamic assert and refute messages, which is required to
    > improve combined assertions like `calledOnceWith` in
    > `@sinonjs/refere-sinon`.
    >
- [`f9d0c82`](https://github.com/sinonjs/referee/commit/f9d0c82c2c4eef6951922fd453f9ed6f7bdc242a)
  Fix tests in node 12.14.1 (Morgan Roderick)
    >
    > Some tests were failing in node 12.14.1, because of changes (likely
    > improvements) to object formatting. By using `util.inspect` in tests, we
    > can match the strings correctly, no matter the node version.

  Fix Node 16 (Morgan Roderick)
    >
    > The object formatting changed (improved) slightly between Node 14 and 16, which
    > broke some of the tests.
    >
    > Since https://github.com/sinonjs/referee/pull/183, we're supposed to be using a
    > frozen version of `util` for formatting values for error messages. Looks like we
    > missed a few places.
